# hello-world
this is for me, the newb, to practice GitHub stuffz

I'm a pretty interesting dude. I've lived and worked in the Bay Area for 10 years and am moving towards a career that can take care of myself and my family in a world where just keeping your head above water can take all of your energy. I love making and drinking coffee. I was a barista for years. I learned to pour latte art as quickly as a I could. I love the art that makes all things. Everything is an art to be cherished. It is my goal to unveil the art behind everything, to show the world what beauty lies beneath, to give the world the unifying knowledge of wonder and amazement.
